>> Platform used is Arduino Uno Rev 3.

>> The language mainly used is C++.

>> Input mode is primitive. The message is transferred via Serial Monitor using UART protocol.
   Input mode can be upgraded via different sensors. (Upcoming varients of this project)
   
>> Input is confined to English alphabets(NOT case sensitive).

>> Two output components are used:
   1. 2 LEDs
   2. 2 Active Buzzers 

>> Please refer to the attached "Moorse_Code_Info.pdf" file for Moorse Code rules and validation.

>> Basic unit of time measurement is 1 second.

// Feedback is always Welcomed. There is always a room for improvement.</br>
