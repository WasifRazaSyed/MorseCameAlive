# Moorse Code Digital Application

![Moorse Code Logo](link-to-your-image-file.png)

This project is a digital application of Morse Code, named after Samuel Morse, and was historically used as the primary means of telecommunication starting in 1836. The inspiration for this project comes from the SOS distress signal.

## Platform and Language

- **Platform:** Arduino Uno Rev 3
- **Language:** C++

## Input Mode

The input mode is primitive, and messages are transferred via Serial Monitor using the UART protocol. Future versions may include upgraded input modes through different sensors.

**Note:** Input is confined to English alphabets (not case-sensitive).

## Output Components

The project utilizes two output components:

1. LED
2. Active Buzzers

For Morse Code rules and validation, please refer to the attached "Moorse_Code_Info.pdf" file.

## Unit of Time Measurement

The basic unit of time measurement in this project is 1 second.
